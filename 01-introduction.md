# How is CSS rendered
1. Browser loads HTML
2. Converts HTML to the DOM
3. Fetched linked resources
4. Browser parses CSS
5. Render tree is laid out
6. UI is painted

# Terminology and basic concepts

- Replaced elements: elements where the content is replaced by something not directly represented in the document content
  - img, input, textarea, select, object, video, audio, iframe
- Non-replaced elements: elements where the content is presented by the user agent (generally a browser) inside a box generated by the element itsel
  - h1, p, div, span, a, ul, ol, li, table, form, button, etc.

# Elements

- Block elements: generate an element box that fills its parents element's content area and cannot have other elements beside it in the same line
  - div, h1, p, ul, ol, li, table, form, etc.
- Inline elements: generate an element box that is flowed with the surrounding content
  - span, a, img, input, textarea, select, etc.

# Selectors

- Universal selector: `*`
- Type selector: `h1`, `p`, `div`, `span`, `a`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `table`, `form`, `button`, etc.
- Class selector: `.class-name`
- ID selector: `#id-name`

## Combining selectors
- Descendant selector: `div p`
- Child selector: `div > p`
- Adjacent sibling selector: `div + p`
- General sibling selector: `div ~ p`
- Attribute selector: `input[type="text"]`

## Inheritance
The process by which some properties of an element are passed to its children

## Specificity
The means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied

!important: a rule that has a higher priority than normal
- Not recommended to use
```css
p {
  color: red !important;
}
```
## Specificity
- Id > class > type
- Id: 1-0-0
- Class: 0-1-0
- Type: 0-0-1

When combining, the values are added together
